#Installing ubuntu
Finally  installed ubuntu in my second attempt. 
I downloaded ubuntu software from it's official website. i've done installing ubuntu after watching a tutorrial in youtube when i tried installing for the first time i was not able figure out what exactly the problem was and ended up getting an error message like installation failed.
Then i gave a second attempt after uninstalling it this time i gave a partition after shrinking 60gb volume  of ssd for ubuntu . and formated the pendrive containing ubuntu file and tried installing ubuntu from boot manager and did some necessary steps for installing it after installing ubuntu i installed wifi drivers as i was not able to connect to wifi. now ubuntu works fine in my laptop :)
